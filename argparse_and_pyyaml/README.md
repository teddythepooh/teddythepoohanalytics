### Requirements
1. Python (see `./env.yml`)

### About
`argparse` and `pyyaml` are two lightweight yet powerful modules to write production-level code.
- `./yaml.ipynb`: how to define configurable parameters in YAML
- `./cli.py`: how to use argparse from the command line
- `./cli_interactive.ipynb`: how to test and prototype a script that uses argparse using a Jupyter notebook
