### Requirements
1. Python (see `./env.yml`)

### About
`argparse` and `pyyaml` are two lightweight yet powerful modules to write production-level code.
- [`yml.ipynb`](./yml.ipynb): how to define configurable parameters in YAML
- [`cli.py`](./cli.py): how to use `argparse` from the command line
- [`cli_interactive.ipynb`](./cli_interactive.ipynb): how to test and prototype a script that uses `argparse` from within a Jupyter notebook
